# Gran Theft Crop Toe

Grant Theft Crop Toe is a game.

It is using the PyTMX and PyScroll libraries by bitcraft (https://github.com/bitcraft).

Once the game is finished the aim wll be to pillage all the towns in search of wheat (the 'Crop' part of the name) which wll be traded in other towns in return for weapons 
and food. Randomly generated chests con be found around the maps.

To run the game, click on run.cmd on Windows or run.sh on Linux. There should be no dependancies or things you need to install before the game gets run, everything is self contained.

The game is still in a Pre-Alpha phase. Any contributions are welcome.
