# GTC

GTC uses the PyTMX and PyScroll libraries by bitcraft (https://github.com/bitcraft).

Once the game is finished, the aim wll be to pillage all the towns in search of wheat which wll be traded in other towns in return for weapons and food. Randomly generated chests can be found around the maps.

To run the game, click on run.cmd on Windows or run.sh on Linux. There should be no dependancies or things you need to install before the game gets run, everything is self contained. It generally works better on Linux with system installed Python ( >= 3.5 ) and PyGame ( >= 1.9 )

The game is still in a Pre-Alpha phase. Any contributions are welcome.
